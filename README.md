# DDLC-Our_Reality

Our Reality is yet another save the Dokis mod. However, there are a few differences that should change the experience entirely.

OR takes place after act 4.

Dokis retain memories and Monika's personality changes. They aren't as bad because Monika's no longer constantly pushing them, but they're noticeable.

Due to this, while you can pick one girl to romance, successfully finishing the mod requires spending time with and helping all the girls in a single route.

This mod won't strictly stick to confirmed lore. The goal is for all changes to be possible enough that you can pick out "foreshadowing" for mod content from the original game.
